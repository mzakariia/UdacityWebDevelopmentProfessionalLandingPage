## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Description

This is a project done for the Udacity frontend web development professional track scholarship. This is the modified landing page with added navigation and active section highlighting,
added clicking functionality on navigation items to scroll to desired section and scroll to top functionality.
The Skeleton HTML & CSS were provided by Udacity, however, the css file was modified by me to cater to some of the new features mentioned above.
